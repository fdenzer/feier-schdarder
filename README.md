Would you like me to create any additional issues or modify the existing ones? The implementation plan follows modern web development practices with:

TypeScript for type safety
React for UI components
Tailwind CSS for styling
Static data files
Unit testing
Component documentation

This avoids random number generation by using standard arrays and point buy systems instead of dice rolls. The web platform allows easy deployment via GitHub Pages.
